Pantone-Color-Book-Builder
==========================

AI script for building out a pantone book for use with print system spot color matching.

Notes before you start
==========================
- It is critical that you do not change any of the group or layer structuring for this to work.
- When you run the script it will appear as if AI has frozen, just wait it out. It is CPU intensive and single threaded.

Instructions 
==========================
1. Copy script to your AI scripts directory (C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator CC 2014\Presets\en_US\Scripts)
2. Open Illustrator and open the template file. Replace the logo with your own logo or title.
3. Type in the printer name and media name into the bottom of the page.
4. Run the script!
5. Adjust things freely to fit media as needed. The guide lines are the cut lines and match the pantone size / style.
6. Print & Color match!
